# Challenges
For starters, I am having trouble figuring out how to move the date into the sql databse itself, will have to look at previous lectures/do some research online
* the thought process is this right now:
  1. go line by line
  2. convert the line into sring
  3. split the string, save the values in temp arr
  4. convert the values into the correct format
  5. save the values in the sql database
  6. repeat until the end of file

I'll have to test each of these step individually but its a plan for now.
